# ps-vs22-ca "Greenfield" project
Demo project assets for my Pluralsight course "Code Analysis with Visual Studio 2022"

## Overview
The Greenfield project is a simple set of objects and pages that represent the start of a short-term vacation rental site with a twist. Instead of renting someone's apartment, you're renting their undeveloped property to use for day use or overnight camping trips. It's like a regular apartment rental site, but without the apartment.
