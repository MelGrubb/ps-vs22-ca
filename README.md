# ps-vs22-ca "Greenfield" project
Demo project assets for my Pluralsight course "Code Analysis with Visual Studio 2022"

## Overview
The Greenfield project is a simple set of objects and pages that represent the start of a short-term vacation rental site with a twist. Instead of renting someone's apartment, you're renting their undeveloped property to use for day use or overnight camping trips. It's like a regular apartment rental site, but without the apartment.

## Getting started
- Clone the application locally, and do a build.
- From the Package Manager Console, run an `update-database` to create the starter database in your LocalDB instance.

## Users
The database is seeded with two users
- greenfield.admin@globomantics.com / P@55w0rd
- greenfield.test@globomantics.com / P@55w0rd
